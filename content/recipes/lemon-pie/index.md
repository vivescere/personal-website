## Recipe

Source: [TARTE AU CITRON MERINGUÃ‰E | VEGAN -  Lloyd Lang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaStrywOa3k)

This took about 2 hours to make. It's enough for more than 5 people, and is easy to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

One of the best desserts I've done so far, I'd give it a 4.75/5. I love the effect of the lemon's sourness on the taste.
