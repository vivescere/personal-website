## Recipe

Source : [Homemade Energy Bars - So Vegan](https://www.wearesovegan.com/homemade-energy-bars/)

This took about 1h20 to prepare and bake, and produces around 10 energy bars (9 on the pictures, plus an extra one). It's really easy to make.

### Ingredients

- 85g oats
- 85g pumpkin seeds
- 150g almonds
- 80g raw buckwheat groats
- 70g raisins
- 70g dried cranberries
- 170g soft dried apricots
- 4 tablespoons of maple syrup
- 4 tablespoons of water

### Steps

- Preheat the oven to 180°c, and prepare a large (the original said 18x18cm) square tin with greaseproof paper. We used a silicon mold instead.
- Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Spread the oats, pumpkin seeds and almonds evenly accross the tray, then roast for 10min.
- While it's cooking, mix the apricots, maple syrup and water in a blender until it becomes a smooth paste. You can add water if the blender is struggling.
- Transfer the apricot mixture to a mixing bowl along with the buckwheat groats, raisins and cranberries.
- Remove the baking tray from the oven and transfer the oats, pumpkin seeds and almonds to the large mixing bowl, and give everything a good mix. Leave the oven turned on.
- Transfer the mixture to the square tin. Make sure it's compact, or the bars will crumble afterwards. Bake for 20min.
- Remove the tin from the oven and leave it to cool completely. Don't try to slice the bars before it's cooled, it will once again make the bars crumble afterwards.
- Take the mixture out of the tin, and slice it into 10 energy bars.

## Results

The bars are really good! Next time I make some, I'll probably try to use other cheaper ingredients - the 10 bars I made cost roughly 15€.

Overall, I'd give them a 4.5/5.
