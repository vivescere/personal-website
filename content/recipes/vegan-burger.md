## Recipe

Source: [WHOLE FOOD VEGAN BURGER | NUT FREE, NO TVP & NO BEANS -  The Happy Pear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0oFBEnVgQA)

This took about 2 hours to make. It's enough for 4 people, and is easy to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

Those were really good, with the "steaks" being the best part of the burgers. I was surprised by how well they stayed together, I didn't have any issues with this.

Overall, I'd give them a 4.75/5.
