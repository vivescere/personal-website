## Recipe

Source: [5 INGREDIENT CHOCOLATE SALTED CARAMEL TART | THE BEST VEGAN DESSERT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2APMIdmqP0)

This took about 2 hours to make. It's enough for a lot of people, and is easy to make.

### Ingredients

- 250g cashew nuts
- 450g dates
- 120g + 6 tablespoons coconut oil
- 150g peanut butter (smooth if possible, mine wasn't as smooth as in the original recipe), or almond butter
- 300g chocolate
- 6-10 tablespoons water

### Steps

- Blend the cashews in a mixer/food processor until it becomes as thin as flour. Add in 150g of dates and 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and mix again until it all comes together.
- Pour the mixture in a 20cm cake tin, using a cooking sheet at least on the bottom. I added 4 little strips on the sides (still attached to the bottom face), to be able to pull out the tart later on.
- Compact the mixture, you can use a cooking sheet to avoid it sticking to your spoon/knife.
- Blend the rest of the dates (300g), the peanut butter, 120g of coconut oil and the water. You don't have to wash the mixer/food processor. This should take quite a long time (around 10 minutes for me). It should have a proper caramel texture ; if it doesn't then mix again (or add more water if it's not mixing).
- Spread the new mixture on top of the old one, you can use the same cooking sheet & spoon to make it smooth.
- Melt the chocolate and 4 tablespoons of coconut oil by making a bain-marie.
- Pour the chocolate in the cake tin.
- Refrigerate for at least an hour.

## Results

This is absolutely delicious, but if you eat too much of it you'll get sick. It's **really** heavy, and best consumed in small doses.

Overall, I'd give it a 5/5.
