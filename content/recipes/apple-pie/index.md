## Recipe

Source : [Vegan Apple Pie - Tasty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EObBCXJ3BeA&t=54s)

This took about 3 hours and a half to make (I was really slow). It's enough for at least 5 people, and isn't easy, but isn't hard to make.

### Ingredients

- 310g all-purpose flour (and a little bit extra if the dough gets sticky)
- 400g + 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon organic sugar
- 1 + 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 225g vegan butter (cubed and chilled)
- 6 tablespoons of ice water
- 7 apples (I only used 5)
- 1 lemon, zested (I didn't put this in)
- 1/2 lemon, juiced (I used a tablesppon of lemon juice)
- 5 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil + 1 teaspoon
- 4 teaspoons cinnamon

### Steps

- In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar (a tablespoon) and salt (a teaspoon).
- Add the cubed butter, bit by bit, using a fork to work it into the flour until it breaks down.
- Gradually add the ice water and mix until the dough can be pressed together.
- Divide the dough in two parts, and shape them into discs. Wrap them in plastic and put them in the fridge for one hour.
- Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
- Peel and core the apples, then cut them into thin slices. Put them in a large bowl and add sugar (200g), the lemon zest, cornstarch, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of coconut oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 3 teaspoons cinnamon. Toss until the apples are well-coated.
- On a lightly floured surface, roll both of the discs of dough to about 2cm thick. Transfer one to a greased 20cm pie dish, and gently press against the bottom and sides. Trim the excess dough around the edges, then prick the bottom of the pie crust all over with a fork.
- Pour the apples into the dish, and cover with the top crust. Trim the excess dough around the edges, then crimp the top and bottom crusts together with a fork.
- Brush the top of the crust with a tablespoon of coconut oil, sprinkle a teaspoon of sugar and cinnamon.
- Cut 4 vents in the top crust.
- Bake for one hour, until the crust is starting to turn golden brown.

## Results

It was delicious, altough really heavy. Maybe there was too much sugar this time, I'd also like to try to perfect the top crust. The biggest pain point I can find is that it takes way too long to make - I spent almost the whole afternoon making it (because I'm still really slow at cooking).

Overall, I'd give it a 4.75/5.
