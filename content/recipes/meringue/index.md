## Recipe

Source: [VEGAN MERINGUE RECIPE -  The Happy Pear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkRylRw0QfI)

This took about 30 minutes to make (plus 2-3 hours for baking). It's enough for more than 5 people, but is kind of hard to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

Those are easy to mess up. For example, I almost made a plate of sticky meringues by cooking them for only 2 hours.

However, the finished product is really good, and I'd give these meringues a 4.75/5.
