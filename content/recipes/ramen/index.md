## Recipe

Source: [EASY VEGAN RAMEN | THE HAPPY PEAR #OILFREE -  The Happy Pear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur9vOD5JE7Y)

This took more than an hour to make. It's enough for 4 people, and is easy to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

Those are absolutely delicious. Altough I've not tried a lot of ramens in my life, I could tell this was not bad at all. I'd give them a 5/5.
