## Recipe

Source: [Baked Tofu Sandwich with Roasted Red Pepper - From the comfort of my bowl](https://www.fromthecomfortofmybowl.com/baked-tofu-sandwich-roasted-red-pepper/)

This took about 45min to make. It's enough for 4 people, and is really easy to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

This is a perfectly fine sandwich, and as such I'll give it a 4.5/5. The catch is that it'll only be as good as the bread you use.
