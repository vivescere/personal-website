Welcome to my personal list of recipes.

I use [this website](https://www.myparisiankitchen.com/en/conversions-and-measures/) to convert all of the quantities, so that they're usable in France.

Most of the text of each recipe is copied from its source: I write the recipes - adding my own notes - before cooking, and then type what I wrote.

This has benefits: even if the source goes down, I'll still have the recipe. Also, if the origin recipe is a video, I get a written recipe. Finally, I can add personal notes, making it easier for me to bake something again.
