Welcome to my personnal list of recipes.

My current goal is to bake something every day, for the entirety of June.

I use [this website](https://www.myparisiankitchen.com/en/conversions-and-measures/) to convert all of the quantities, so that they're usable in France.

Most of the text of the recipes might almost be taken from their sources : I write the recipes with little notes before cooking them, and then type what I wrote.
