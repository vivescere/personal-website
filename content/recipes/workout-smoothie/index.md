## Recipe

Source: [3 Post-Workout Smoothies - simply quinoa](https://www.simplyquinoa.com/3-post-workout-smoothies/)

This took about 10 minutes to make. It's enough for 4 people, and is really easy to make (you just have to blend the ingredients).

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

After my first time trying this recipe, I took some liberties with the ingredients, adding what I had in the fridge with pretty good results.

Those can be really good, and I craved them after coming back from my workout sessions. I'd give them a 4.5/5 (I preferred the second recipe).
