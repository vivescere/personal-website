See the [pizza recipes](/recipes/2020/06/04/pizza) these were used on.

### Pesto Rosso

This took about 15min to make. It's enough for at least 5 people, and is really easy to make.

#### Ingredients

- 100g (oil) dried tomatoes
- 25g pine nut
- A (small) clove of garlic
- Around 15 basil leaves (of all sizes)
- 7cl olive oil
- Pepper
- A teaspoon of tomato coulis

#### Steps

- Carefully mix the tomatoes, tomato coulis, basil, garlic (peeled and minced), olive oil and pine nut in a blender.

### Basil Pesto

This took about 20min to make. It's enough for at least 5 people, and is relatively easy to make.

#### Ingredients

- 50g of basil leaves
- 100ml olive oil
- 20g pine nut
- A bit of coarse salt
- A clove of garlic
- 100g of plan tofu

#### Steps

- Clean and dry the basil.
- Mix using a blender in small strokes the garlic (chopped), the basil leaves (roughly chopped), the salt, the tofu (crumbled) and half the oil. Don't stop until the pesto becomes creamy.
- Add the pine nuts (cut in thin slices) and the remaining oil.

## Results

They were good on the pizzas ; I also tasted the rosso pesto with pasta and it was really good, maybe a bit too strong. There definitely was too much of it for the pizzas too, we used maybe 1/4th of what we made.

Overall, I'd give them a 4/5.
