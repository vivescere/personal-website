## Recipe

Source : [The perfect {vegan} banana bread - Valentina | The Baking Fairy](https://www.thebakingfairy.net/2015/05/the-perfect-vegan-banana-bread/)

This took about an hour to prepare and bake, and is not too hard to make.

### Ingredients

- 4 medium ripe bananas
- 60ml vegetable oil
- 60ml unsweetened nondairy milk
- 125g light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 260g unbleached all-purpose flour (in France : T80 flour)
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- A sliced banana, for topping

### Steps

- Preheat the oven at 175Â°C. Spray a 9x5 loaf pan with oil, then flour.
- In a large mixing bowl, roughly mash the bananas. Add the brown sugar, oil, vanilla and almond milk, and whisk to incorporate.
- Mix in the floor, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon and stir until combined. Do not overmix, or the banana bread can come out dense and gummy.
- Transfer the batter to your prepared pan, and top with the extra banana slices.
- Bake for about 45min, until a tootpick inserted in the center comes out with just a couple crumbs.<br/>The original recipe recommends baking the bread again with foil on top, for 10-15 minutes longer. We didn't find that this was necessary, as the bread seemed cooked enough for us.

## Results

The bread was really good! The top was perfectly cooked, but the bottom was maybe too soft. Overall, I'd give it a 4.5/5.

It wasn't really hard to unmold, but adding a baking sheet between the bread and the mold may be a good idea.
