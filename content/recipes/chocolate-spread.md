## Recipe

This took about half an hour to make. It's enough to fill a relatively large jar (see the pictures), and is really easy to make.

### Ingredients

- 50g of raw cane sugar
- 50g of roasted unsalted peanuts
- 85g of hazelnut powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla bean powder
- A pinch of salt
- 85g of sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder
- 200ml of water

### Steps

- In a small saucepan, add the sugar and water together. Cook over medium heat, up until the sugar is dissolved.
- Meanwhile, finely mix the peanuts using a blender.
- Add the sugared water in the blender, and mix again.
- Add in the hazelnut powder, the vanilla, the salt, and the oil, then mix again until you get a homogeneous paste.
- Pour the mixture into a saucepan, and warm it over medium heat, without cooking it. Add the cocoa without stopping mixing.
- Once the mixture is smooth, remove the pan from the heat. Pour it into a jar, and let it sit.

## Results

So the taste is really not what I was expecting, you almost can't tell there's chocolate in it, and you really only taste the peanuts and the hazelnuts.

But, at the same time, I really like it. I enjoyed putting it on a slice of bread this morning.

Apart from this, the texture is not really was I was expecting either. It's more liquid than your typical chocolate spread.

Overall, I'd give it a 4.5/5.
