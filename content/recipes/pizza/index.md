## Recipe

Sources :
- [EASY VEGAN PIZZA FROM SCRATCH - The Happy Pear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RdKPHibSME)
- Recettes vegan inratables - Les petits inratables. Ed. Larousse

The second source is for the dough, which we used instead of the one proposed in the video because it used ingredients not readily available in France.

This took about 1 hour and a half to make. It's enough for 5 people, and is relatively easy to make - the dough is the hardest part.

We had enough to make two pizzas:
- one as presented in the video
- one without tomato, with spinach leaves and cashew cream

Note: A typical pizza is about 200g of dough.

### Ingredients

#### For all pizzas

- 300g wheat flour (in France: T55), reserve a bit more - it might be needed
- Dry baker's yeast
- A teaspoon of sugar
- 3 teaspoons of olive oil
- A teaspoon of salt
- 20cl of lukewarm water
- Pine nuts
- [Basil pesto](/recipes/2020/06/04/pesto)

#### For the pizza presented in the video

- Tomato sauce
- [Pesto rosso](/recipes/2020/06/04/pesto)
- Vegetables (faster cooking ones preferably) ; here we chose a sweet potato, a red pepper and a yellow pepper
- Salt
- Olive oil

#### For the tomato-free pizza

- 50g of cashews
- 250ml soy milk, sugar-free
- A lot of spinach leaves

### Steps

#### Preparation
- Put the flour in a large bowl, forming a well in the middle.
- Add in the salt to the side, the yeast and the sugar to the center.
- Add in the water and start kneading it, incorporating the olive oil as you go. Add more flour if it starts getting sticky.
- Let the dough rest for an hour in a warm place.
- Preheat the oven at 250 degrees, make it so that the heat is coming from the bottom.
- Knead the dough again and spread **half** of it on a baking tray covered with a baking sheet. Roll the sides a bit to form the border of the pizza.

#### For the tomato pizza
- In a bowl, mix the tomato sauce and about a 100g of pesto.
- Cut the vegetables in slices. If you chose vegetables that take more time to cook, cut them in thinner slices.
- Put them into another bowl, add olive oil and salt then mix.
- Spread the mix of tomato sauce and pesto in the pizza.
- Put the vegetables on the pizza.
- Add little balls of basil pesto on the top (we put around 10 of them).
- Add pine nuts on top.
- Bake for 12min.

#### For the tomato-free pizza

- Mix the cashews with the soy milk in a blender until you reach a creamy texture. Spread it on the dough.
- Add the spinach leaves on top, followed by little spots of basil pesto (we put around 10 of them) and the pine nuts.
- Bake for 12min.

## Results

They tasted great, although the tomato-free one wasn't as good.

Overall, I'd give them a 4.75/5.
