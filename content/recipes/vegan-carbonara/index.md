## Recipe

Source: [EPIC VEGAN CARBONARA in 5 MINUTES! | THE HAPPY PEAR -  The Happy Pear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_qUHFx-jCI)

This took about 45min to make. It's enough for 4-5 people, and is easy to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

While the result isn't the most beautiful thing to look at, it's definitely tasty. I particularly liked the shiitake mushrooms, which have a distinct taste. I'd give this carbonara a 4.75/5.
