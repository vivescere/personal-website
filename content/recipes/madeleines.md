## Recipe

Source: [Madeleines sans oeufs, sans lait {vegan} - Perle en sucre](https://perleensucre.com/madeleines-sans-oeufs-sans-lait-vegan/)

This took about 10 minutes (before waiting) and 40min (after waiting, using a 9x mold). It's enough for 18 smallish madeleines, and is really easy to make.

### Ingredients

- 150g flour
- 100g sugar
- 4g baking powder
- 2 pinches of salt
- 110ml plant milk
- 70ml peanut oil
- 1 vanilla bean or a teaspoon of vanilla powder
- A few drops of bitter almond aroma

And if you want to wrap the bottom of the madeleines with a chocolate shell, count one square of chocolate per madeleine.

### Steps

- Mix every ingredient (except the chocolate) in a large bowl, until the mixture is smooth.
- Wrap the bowl in plastic and let it sit for at least 2 hours, ideally the whole night.
- Fill the molds at 3/4.
- Bake for 4 minutes at 250°C (I used 220°C because my oven doesn't go that high), and then from 4 to 10 minutes at 200°C.
- Put the madeleines in an airtight box while they cool.

If you want to wrap them with a chocolate shell, wait until they're cool, melt the chocolate, put the equivalent of 1 square in each hole of the mold, and cast the madeleines in them.

## Results

This is delicious, but be careful, you have to cook them enough or they'll stick to the mold. I baked them for 12 minutes and it was perfect.

I'd give them a 5/5, because they're so fast to make.
