## Recipe

Source: [5 INGREDIENT CARROT CAKE | VEGAN LOCK DOWN DESSERT -  The Happy Pear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayV5ChBUKa4&t=0s)

This took more than 4 hours to make because I only had one mold. It's enough for more than 5 people, and is not too hard to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

This is really good, I baked it for a birthday and (I think) everyone loved it. Note that it's really dense, we took around 4 days to finish it.

I messed up the cream a bit, so it wasn't perfectly white.

I'd give it a perfect score - next time I'll try getting the specific molds that are recommended (two with removable bottoms), which should make the baking time a lot shorter.
