## Recipe

Source: [Macarons au chocolat Vegan à base d’aquafaba - Déliacious](https://deliacious.com/2018/03/macarons-chocolat-vegan-aquafaba.html)

This took about an hour and a half to make. It's enough for 4+ people, and is really hard to make (at least, to make them look good).

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

I didn't expect it to be that hard to get beautiful macaroons. You have to get the baking time exactly right - which I didn't. I'll have to try again sometime.

Still, even if they were not pretty to look at, they were pretty good! Overall, I'd give them a 4.25/5.
