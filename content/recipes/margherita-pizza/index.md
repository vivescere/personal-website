## Recipe

Source: [PIZZA MARGHERITA VEGAN | Recette PÃ¢te & Fromage Filant -  Lloyd Lang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=076IaEg90YY)

This took about an hour to make. It's enough for more than 5 people (for a slice each), and is easy to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

This wasn't too bad - I think I'm getting pretty okay at baking pizzas! 

The fake cheese really added to the taste - I'll steal that part for other pizzas.

Overall, I'd give those pizzas a 4.5/5 - they could be more aesthetically pleasing.
