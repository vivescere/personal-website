## Recipe

Source: [Vegan Mozzarella | Vegan Cheese -  The Happy Pear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo2K1nSef2Y)

This took about 30 minutes to prepare, plus a little bit of time for each toast. It's enough for 5+ people, depending on how many toasts each person eats, and is really easy to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

Those were delicious, I ate too many toasts and didn't even regret it. I'd give them a 5/5.
