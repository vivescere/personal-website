## Recipe

Source: [Homemade Vegan Ravioli with Pesto Cashew Cheese Filling | Sensible Plate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I3Sk5tK-wM)

This took more than 2 hours to make. It's enough for 4-5 people, and is easy to make.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

I'd give those a 4.25/5. They're good, but long to make for what you get. I'd love to try different fillings though!
