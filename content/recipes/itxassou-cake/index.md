## Recipe

Source: [La france végétalienne](https://petite-collection-v.myshopify.com/collections/france-vegetalienne/products/la-france-vegetalienne), p. 246.

This took about 2 hours to make. It's enough for more than 5 people, and is relatively easy to make - I just struggled a bit to add the top layer.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm creating this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

The cake is really good, but the jam is a bit too much; it makes the taste a little too sugary. Overall, I'd give it a 4.25/5.
