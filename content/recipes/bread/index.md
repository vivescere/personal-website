## Recipe

Source: [Pain sans Pétrissage | Sain & 100% Végétal - Lloyd Lang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d7pFDvNXE8)

This took about 10 minutes to make (a little less than 2 hours if you count the baking time plus the waiting time). It's really easy to make.

### Ingredients

- 375g of flour
- 300ml of lukewarm water
- 12g of baker's yeast (a sachet will work just fine - it's what I used)
- Optional: salt, nuts, or anything you want in your bread.

### Steps

- In a large bowl, mix the baker's yeast and the water, then, once it's well diluted, let stand for 5 minutes.
- Add in the flour and mix well. This is where you can add salt, nuts or anything your want. The dough should be sticky.
- Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel, and put in your oven for one hour at 40°C.
- Meanwhile, add a baking sheet in a cake mold.
- Once the hour is up the dough should have expanded to twice its size. Preheat the oven to 220°C, and put the dough in the cake mold, and let it stand again for 5 minutes.
- Put it in the oven for 35 minutes.

## Results

This seems like a really easy recipe that I can easily see myself doing every few days. I didn't add salt this time, so that felt like it was missing.

Overall, I'd give the bread a 4.5/5.
