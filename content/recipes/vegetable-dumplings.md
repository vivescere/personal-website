## Recipe

Source: [Vegetable Dumplings (Vegan Gyoza / Potstickers) - Bianca Zapatka](https://biancazapatka.com/en/vegetable-dumplings-vegan-gyoza/#wprm-recipe-container-15016)

This took about 2 hours to make. It's enough for 4 people, and is easy to make, except for the original shape which I didn't replicate.

**I'm not writing the recipe here, as I'm publishing this page more than a month after baking this.**

## Results

I'd give those a 4/5. They're really good, but long to make for what you get, just like the ravioli I made yesterday; also the original shape, which is way better looking, is really hard to replicate.
