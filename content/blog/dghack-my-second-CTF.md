I joined this CTF because there was a possiblity to get an internship (or a job). I think I did pretty well, ranking 1/1214 among the students, and 5 overall out of 2066 :)

This was a whole lot of fun, I got to learn a ton of things, lose some sleep, and make new friends. I can't wait for my next CTF!
