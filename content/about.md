Hi! I'm Nicolas Bourras, aka vivescere - a french student learning computer science at the Aix-Marseille university. I started my fourth year in 2020, specializing myself in security.

I love cycling, programming, photography and more recently I started getting into [cooking](/recipes) as well. I'm also vegan.

I mainly program in Rust these days, but I also regularly use Dart (with flutter) and python. I have experience with a fairly large number of languages, so don't hesite to ask me about them.

## What I've been working on

This section is a bit empty for now - I've done a lot of school projets that aren't good enough to be here.

### CTF - DG'hAck

I wrote an article on this CTF, which you can read [here](/blog/dghack-my-second-ctf/). It's complete with writeups for 14 challenges, out of the 16 I've completed.

I ranked first out of all the students ; there was only 3 challenges that I didn't manage to solve, I still need to get better at reverse engineering / binary exploitation!

### CTF - DGSE - Brigitte Friang

My first CTF! I ranked 61 ouf of 785 teams, while being alone. It was a great learning experience.

### Introduction to Flutter

[View the playlist on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=524K0rNP6wc&list=PL-sAExtisOFBM8O9f6gCCBWq2ndJAmDuG)

This series of videos (in french) was an attempt at teaching Flutter, a framework made by Google which is used to create mobile applications. Unfortunately, it didn't go very far because I started working on some other projects.

### Beacon (2016)

[View the application on the play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vivescere.beacon)

This application allows an athlete (or anyone who wants to, really) to share their location in realtime.

I use it to stay safe when I go cycling. Sometimes you go out for a really long time, and knowing that the contacts you chose can check on you in a few seconds really lifts a weight off your shoulders.
